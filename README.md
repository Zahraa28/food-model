# 🍔 Food Image Recognition & Calorie Estimation

This project uses deep learning to recognize food from images and estimate its calorie content based on USDA data.
It's affiliated with the Prodigy Infotech Internship Program as Task 5 . 
Finally 5/5 projects 🥳🥳🎉

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 📷 Classify food items from photos using a pretrained CNN
- 📏 (Optional) Estimate portion size using object detection
- 🔥 Estimate total calories per serving
- 🌐 Provide a simple Streamlit web interface
